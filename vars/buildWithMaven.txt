<h3>Usage: buildWithMaven()</h3>
performs a complete maven-based build of the project.

An optional closure can be used to set project configuration.

skipSonar: to bypass sonar
skipTests: to bypass all tests
X11: to launch an X11 server for headless ui testing

Example:
Standard build:
buildWithMaven()

Build that bypass sonar and all testings, don't do that:
buildWithMaven() {
   skipSonar = true
   skipTests = true
}

Build that launches an X11 server for headless ui testing:
buildWithMaven() {
   X11 = true
}
