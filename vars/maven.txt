<h3>Usage: maven(String goals, String version, x11, skipTests)</h3>
sets artifactory, docker and, if desired, the Xvfb X11 server, and executes the given goals with maven.

If the version is publishable, any artifacts, including docker images, will be published.

A typical pipeline calls this step multiple times for a given version, typically up to three times: for the main build,
for the sonar build and for the release build. The buildInfoQualifier is used to distinguish between these builds and
prevents from publishing artifacts from the sonar build.
